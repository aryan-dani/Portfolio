# 🚀 My Portfolio – A No-Framework Challenge  

Welcome to my personal portfolio! 🎨💻 This project is a **self-imposed challenge** to build a fully functional, responsive, and visually appealing portfolio using **only HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SCSS** – **no frameworks, no libraries, just pure code!**  

## 🌟 Why This Challenge?  

In a world dominated by frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, I wanted to **push my limits** and strengthen my core front-end skills. This project is about:  
- **Mastering Vanilla JavaScript** for interactivity  
- **Crafting beautiful UI/UX with only CSS & SCSS**  
- **Building everything from scratch** without dependencies  

## 🔥 Features  

- 🎭 **Minimal & Modern Design** – Clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate  
- 📱 **Fully Responsive** – Looks great on all devices  
- 🎨 **SCSS for Styling** – Clean, maintainable, and scalable styles  
- 📂 **Custom-Built Components** – No Bootstrap, Tailwind, or UI libraries  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **HTML5** – Semantic, structured markup  
- **CSS3 / SCSS** – Custom styling with modular SCSS  
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** – For the navigation pane animation 
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and project hosting
