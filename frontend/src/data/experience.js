  bio: `Hey, I'm Aryan Dani, a code-wrangler who sometimes fancies himself a full-stack developer and an AI enthusiast. When I'm not battling CSS for that perfect layout or convincing JavaScript (and my deep learning models) to play nice, you'll find me knee-deep in AI experiments or unwinding with Anime like Haikyu!!, dreaming of a quick attack like Hinata (spoiler: I can't even spike).

I'm all about tech and building projects that actually work (most of the time). My portfolio spans everything from an automated expense tracker to cutting-edge AI and deep learning projects—think real-time human detection and adaptive models that learn on the fly (I'm using my powers for good, don't worry).

Future goals? Become the Mrwhosetheboss of my generation, but with more AI magic and less coffee (I'm a tea person, fight me). Let's connect and build something epic—or just geek out over tech and anime together.`,
